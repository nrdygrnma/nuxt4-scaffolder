# nuxt4-scaffolder

A powerful, Bun-based CLI to scaffold and configure Nuxt 4 projects with:

- **Nuxt Image**, **Nuxt Icon** and **Pinia** modules
- **shadcn-nuxt** component library with **shadcn-vue**
- **Tailwind CSS** + Vite integration
- TypeScript support
- Default directory structure under `app/`
- Sample `index.vue` page and `default.vue` layout

## Prerequisites

- **Bun**: [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/) by running:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
  ```
- **Node.js â‰¥ 18** (optional, if you ever need to run `npm` scripts)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/nrdygrnma/nuxt4-scaffolder.git
cd nuxt4-scaffolder

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Link the CLI globally (for development)
bun link
```

## Usage

Run the `create-nuxt-4` command with a project name:

```bash
bunx create-nuxt-4
```

This will automatically:

1. Initialize a Nuxt 4 project (with Nuxt Image, Nuxt Icon, shadcn-nuxt and Pinia) using Bun.
2. Update `package.json` to set the `name` to your project.
3. Configure `nuxt.config.ts` for the project.
4. Install TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, and generate a Tailwind config.
5. Update `nuxt.config.ts` with CSS and Vite plugin settings.
6. Add the `shadcn-nuxt` module and inject its configuration.
7. Attempt to initialize `shadcn-vue` with defaults (continues even if this step fails).
8. Intelligently detect if the project already has a Nuxt 4 folder structure:
   - If not, reorganize core directories under `app/`
   - If yes, preserve the existing structure
9. Create or update `app.vue`, `default.vue` layout and `pages/index.vue` (only if they don't already exist).
10. Add a sample Pinia store and Shadcn `<Button>` component (only if they don't already exist).

## Configuration Options

You can customize which modules are added by editing the CLI source and adding flags or prompts. Contributions welcome!

## Known Issues

- **shadcn-vue Compatibility**: There may be compatibility issues between shadcn-vue and Nuxt 4, especially with newer versions of shadcn-vue that depend on Tailwind CSS v4.1.7. The scaffolder will attempt to initialize shadcn-vue but will continue even if this step fails. You can manually install shadcn-vue later if needed.
